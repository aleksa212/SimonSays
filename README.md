This project is created for practice purposes. After pressing Start game button, random sequence of three colors will start and light up in order that user needs to repeat. If the user succesfully repeats colors in correct order, the level is going to increase by 1 which means that next sequence is going to contain 4 colors and so on. After every success, the sequence is going to be the same as previous one only with 1 additional color added in the end. If user fails to repeat the sequence, the game is over which means level is going to drop on 0, and if the user wants to play again, another random sequence is going to be generated.

This project helped me to better understand setTimeout function and how to nest them. Also it allowed to me practice manipulating the DOM based on state and logic in JavaScript.
